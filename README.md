# Sentiment on Azure
This is some demo code I wrote to show how great PCF runs on Azure and how easy it is to get Spring Boot apps working there.

This uses JPA and any DB (how about MS SQL?) to store sentiment from customers (using the MS sentiment engine). I need to add some GUI code and probably some queries for the data too...

Perhaps some graphs? That'd be nice.
